collection of juptyer notebooks for kaggle
## Titanic
### Achieved 83% ~> principal components RBF kernel with gamma: 0.1 and c:100
- [ ] feature engineering ~> extracted title
- [ ] one-hot encoding on sex and title
- [ ] drop names ~> it's probably irrelevant
- [ ] pca
- [ ] data cleaning ~> realized i dropped way too many labels last time
- [ ] how do I render a juptyer notebook in github?
- [ ] added some more data stories
- [ ] 8 principal components explain 90% of the variance
- [ ] normalize the data
- [ ] standardize the data
- [ ] need to refactor ~> this notebook is getting monolithic
- [ ] need to confusion matrix
- [ ] started the refactor...titanic2.0.ipynb
